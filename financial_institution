# Is our financial institution a parasite?
What value do they produce, they don't build new things, or treat people, or educate, or even keeping our city clean


## Usury
When you're poor but you need to pay higher higher interest to buy a house.
When you're out of job, you're done
You work in a stable job, interest rate goes down (when you have everything, things go a lot easier compared to those who does not have that)
Usury gives the illusion that people can afford more expensive things when the reality is price is spread through the years of repayment and the predatory hidden cost which is the interest rate.

## Insurance
Do you want to help people or just a money making machine?
Are we paying for their admin bloat?
I've heard cases where claims are denied

People talk about raising minimum wages where this helps, it puts a lot of pressure to our small business. What we should focus on are institutions like these where they are making free money without provide a tangible value to our society.
